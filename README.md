# spaceInvadersRemake

Make a 2D action game, built in Godot (or other engine -- Pico-8, Unity, Phaser, etc.), based on an existing early arcade game (e.g., Pong, Breakout, Pac-Man, Defender, Space Invaders, Galaga, Asteroids, etc. -- if it could have existed in 1980 it is an ok fit)

Implement two versions â€”


 1. A straightforward version (i.e. a clone)
 2. A variant that embellishes upon the original game

 Your game must implement:

A menu system to select between the two variants
Sound and Music
Not breaking of copyright law
Builds for Mac,PC, and Linux
